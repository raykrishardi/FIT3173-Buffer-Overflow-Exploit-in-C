# Buffer Overflow Exploit in C

# About the project:
This project is part of my first assignment for the FIT3173 (Software Security) unit. The exploit program (exploit.c) creates a "badfile" which contains NOP instructions and malicious shell code to be injected into another program (stack.c) that has the buffer overflow vulnerability. After the "badfile" has been read by stack.c, attacker will be able to obtain a root shell because the stack.c program is compiled with set-root-uid permission.
